Decorator / Wrapper Design Pattern:
-It allows us to add some new behavior to existing Objects, to existing functionality. (Attach new behavior to an Object).
-It Allows us to do this without modifying existing code. (without altering existing code)
-It also allows us to modify existing functionality (Overriding behavior)
