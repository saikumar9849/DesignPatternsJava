Proxy Design Pattern:
--Definition: This pattern helps to provide control access to original object.
-It allows us to basically have an interface or a another Object in front of some functionality in our code of one or more Objects.
-we provide some functionality before and/or after calling an object.
-The main idea behind the proxy is that it has the "same interface as the original Object".
-It is "Similar to facade, except the proxy has the same interface".
-It is "Similar to decorate, except the proxy manages the lifecycle of it's object".
