Composite Design Pattern:
--Definition: This pattern helps in scenarios where we have OBJECT inside OBJECT(tree like structure)
-Composite works really well when we have tree structures within our system. (Compose objects into Tree structures).
-It works when the core functionality can be represented as a tree.
-Manipulate many Objects as a Single one.
