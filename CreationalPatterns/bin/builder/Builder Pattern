Builder Design Pattern:
It is used when we have multiple parameters to initialize
The more parameters we have, it's impractical to build all constructors (e.g:- 5 parameters combinations -> 120 possible constructor of different types)
It's especially useful when we have optional parameters, when we don't need to initialize of the parameters in certain situations and we want them in other situations
It should be easy to read
