Prototype Design Pattern (Cloning or Copying of Objects):
It basically "allow us to copy existing Objects" in a reliable way.
we don't need to depend on the particularities of their classes.
It is quite useful to relay on a single interface (Only reliant on interface).
The copied Object must provide the copy functionality
This is "useful in testing and pre-production".
