Factory Method Design Pattern:
--Definition: It is used when all the object creation and its business logic we need to keep at one place.
Design logic is hidden from client.
Many Subclass types, only one instance required.
Creation is removed from client
Useful for frequent code changes

How to implement:
1. Interface or abstract class that defines the common functionality
2. Interface implementation
3. factory class that instantiates the right implementation
