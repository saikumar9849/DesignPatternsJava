Factory Method Design Pattern:
Design logic is hidden from client.
Many Subclass types, only one instance required.
Creation is removed from client
Useful for frequent code changes

How to implement:
1. Interface or abstract class that defines the common functionality
2. Interface implementation
3. factory class that instantiates the right implementation
