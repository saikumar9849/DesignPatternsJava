Mediator Design Pattern:
--Definition: It encourage loose coupling by keeping objects from referring to each other explicitly and allows them to communicate through a mediator object.
-It provide a central Object used for communicating between Objects.
-"Objects don't talk to each other". They talk to the mediator, and the mediator relays the message forward.
-Reuces dependencies betwen Objects.
