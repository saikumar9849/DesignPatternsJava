Command Design Pattern:
--Definition: Turns requests(commands) into objects, allowing us to either parametrized or queue them. This will help to decouple the request Sender and receiver.
-Basically the command is wrapper that wraps an object and all the required information to process that command. (A request is wrapped in an object that contains all request info).
-The command Object is passed to the correct handler.
-Decoupling is major benefit in this.
-Efficiency, ordering, priority, etc... (benefits)
