	1. Memento - stores the state (It represents an Object which holds the state of the Originator.)
	2. Originator - creates the state (It represents the object, for which state need to be saved and restored, Expose methods to Save and Restore its state using Memento object.)
	3. caretaker - decides to save or restore the state (Manages the list of states (i.e. list of Memento)
