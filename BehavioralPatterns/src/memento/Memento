Memento Design Pattern:
-It specially created to handle, undo and redo operations.
-It save and restore previous state without revealing implementation details.
-It has 3 components:
	1. Memento - stores the state
	2. Originator - creates the state
	3. caretaker - decides to save or restore the state
