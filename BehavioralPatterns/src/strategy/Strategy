Strategy Design Pattern:
--Definition: Helps to define multiple algorithm for the task and we can select any algorithm depending on the situation.
-It is very useful when we have multiple ways of performing some function or handling some data in our application.
-In this A class behavior or algorithm can be changed at runtime.
-Objects contains algorithm logic
-The context Object can handle algorithm Object.
-This is useful when we want to be able to add functionality without changing program Structure.
