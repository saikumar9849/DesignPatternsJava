State Design pattern:
--Definition: allows an Object to alter its behaviour when its internal state changes.
-The state design pattern is basically the idea of a finite state machine that is a machine or in our case, an algorithm that has a finite number of states that it can be in at a certain time.
-It says that An object changes its behavior based on an internal state.
-At any moment, there's a finite number of states a program can be in.
-The state itself can be encapsulated in an object and passed around to different states and different objects.
